question: Part 1) Positive - what were the things you enjoyed about the application process?  What things worked well for you?  What do you think should be continued for future classes?

cool

question: Part 2) Delta - what were things that should be changed about the process?  What things felt badly structured, overly difficult, or out of place?

didnt like tweeting about it. some people dont use twitter. had to create an account.

i use facebook, not twitter.

question: Is there anything you'd like to change, or see changed?

level 0 and level 1 were too easy. i am very reluctant to put something on a public post on the internet. later someone can bring it up and say "hey what are you doing at this holberton school etc"

i guess i understand them.

very challenging, and it was very good. overall it was fine. only level 0 and level 1 were too easy.

the students should have an idea of what is coming next. outline of the steps.

outside of the interview: many students are going back to the countries next month. it's only going to get more difficult for bilal to do this in the future when the work starts ramping up.

another problem: the twitter project. some people are gonna get 100%
