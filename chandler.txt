question: Part 1) Positive - what were the things you enjoyed about the application process?  What things worked well for you?  What do you think should be continued for future classes?

nothign sticks out.

twitter is a good thing to test basic computer usage.

question: Part 2) Delta - what were things that should be changed about the process?  What things felt badly structured, overly difficult, or out of place?

i dont like using twitter, but doesn't matter. created another twitter account.

not the first time i had to create another twitter account. been hacked multiple times. different accounts. (even with 2-factor auth, and complex passwd)

question: Is there anything you'd like to change, or see changed?

felt unprecise. should be outlined. should reveal about the steps in advance, just for planning purposes.

it was clear that the deadline was dependent upon start date. (the 2 weeks)
