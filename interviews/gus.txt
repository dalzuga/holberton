Interview with Augustin Francis-Boeuf

Visa question

First thing, can foreigners be accepted?

It should be explained prominently if they accept international
students (students from foreign nations).

When Rudy spoke on Skype, it was clear what he explained.

For foreigners they have to create a fake purpose for US Customs and
Immigration, because the school was not formed at the time. Maybe this
will go away now, but maybe not.

Specifically for foreigners, there should be information for the
possibility of working remotely. Also, if there is flexibility in
the curriculum schedule i.e. 3 months, 6 months, 9
months. This should be explained sooner on the application.

Gus had 5 days to do the website cuz he did it at the end

There was a feeling of an involved community on the forums, but Gus
arrived later and everything was dead at that time.

Started level 2 late; proposes fixed flexibility. For camaraderie. The
interaction on the forum was missed out on.

Question: Do you feel that you decided to hold off on level 2 until it
was more clear whether you could attend the program? No.

Do you feel like you would have done it earlier? In this case no.

To clarify, it would be a good thing to have it fixed, even though I
wouldn't be here had it been that way; again, for camaraderie and
interaction on the forum, creating a feeling of community, etc.
