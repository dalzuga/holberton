question: Part 1) Positive - what were the things you enjoyed about the application process?  What things worked well for you?  What do you think should be continued for future classes?

the tweet should stay.

q: would have tweeted if optional?

yes. better image for yourself from holberton admissions' perspective.

q: should it be mandatory?

a: no, optional, shouldn't have an effect. (no points deducted in the application process)

question: Part 2) Delta - what were things that should be changed about the process?  What things felt badly structured, overly difficult, or out of place?

the only thing maybe. made us change github. it would be better to have everything done through the CLI.

question: Is there anything you'd like to change, or see changed?

liked the tweet quite a bit. kinda shared the school. if i tweet about holberton, "oh wow" my followers would say. adds a social element.
