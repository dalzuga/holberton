question: Part 1) Positive - what were the things you enjoyed about the application process?  What things worked well for you?  What do you think should be continued for future classes?

question: Part 2) Delta - what were things that should be changed about the process?  What things felt badly structured, overly difficult, or out of place?

question: Is there anything you'd like to change, or see changed?

comments: it was interesting that after you completed a level, you weren't able to go back and read what you did on the previous level.

q: do you feel that it could be useful on the level 3 interview?
it was good because people were doing the exercises on the spot, but there's no way to go back and get a refresh of what the process was like. it would have been good to review your answers for the previous levels to remind you and make you more prepared to discuss the exercises on the level 3 interview.

especially if your interview is a week after you completed everything on the previous levels.

rudy was cool, liked the interview.

another thing, possibly would be, with this being the initial cohort of the school, it would have been better for me to look at the applicant forum after being accepted. it would have been nice to have read-access to the applicant forum.

only other issue is, i felt pressured to read everyone's medium post to get inspiration to do the medium essay. the instructions could have been more specific, as it felt non-descript.

i felt pressured to catch up on the forum.

the youtube video took me the longest. it was a good thing that they did it. the school really cares about your soft-skills and really wants you to be a part of social media even if you reservations about your privacy and the whole concept of social media.
