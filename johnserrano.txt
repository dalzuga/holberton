question: Part 1) Positive - what were the things you enjoyed about the application process?  What things worked well for you?  What do you think should be continued for future classes?

good idea that we had social media. you had to stand by what you said in a public environment. somebody who is not willing to participate in social media wouldn't be a great fit.

when i did the youtube video, not sure if it's good or bad, but i was able to search through other people's videos and see what worked and what didn't.

i was applying pretty early in the process.

the time zone was not a problem. i didn't wait for the entire deadline to pass.

they didn't say whether they valued speed or quality more. get their decision early, when there's still spots left. "dynamism" has to do with speed.

interviewed closer to 90 people. you're going to be more liberal at the start than in the end. you don't wanna be in a situation where you have not accepted people, and then you have to accept 20 out of those 30. you need to accept more people at the end, and competition wouldn't be good.



question: Part 2) Delta - what were things that should be changed about the process?  What things felt badly structured, overly difficult, or out of place?

question: Is there anything you'd like to change, or see changed?


other comments: it's a positive that giving the applicants as much information as possible is a very good thing to do. it was a good decision not to give a stated preference on that.

quesiton: anything you'd like to add?
